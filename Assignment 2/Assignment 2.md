# Assignment 2

# Requirements
* First and foremost, you need Selenium.
* Download pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
* In Terminal, write the following command:

  ``` pip install Selenium```

* One Selenium is installed, we need to download the WebDriver for Chrome from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
* Put the ChromeDriver in the same folder as your Python file running that would run the test. All the requirements have now been met.
